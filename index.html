          <h2>ST. ANTHONY'S SCHOOL, KURSEONG. <br /></h2>
          <p class="description">
            The perfect ambience for learning ,located in Kurseong also known as
            the land of white orchids. The entrance to the beautiful hills of
            Darjeeling. My school has impacted me in the best way possible. The
            mentors provide incredible assistance in the development of the
            students. While academic excellence is admired greatly,sporting
            acheivements are equally valued.It's not until you finally leave the
            school,you realize what those red brick walls actally represented.
            To me , it reprsents a sense of security from the outside world .
            Leaving your school marks your first step into adulthood.Now,
            adulthood might sound really fancy but it comes with its share of
            responsibilties. Having spent a portion of my life here, i can
            safely say that this school has played a huge role in shaping my
            future and giving me an identity of who i am today.
            <br />
            THANK YOU SO MUCH ST.ANTHONY'S.<br />I've spent the most valuable
            years of my life in this school and I would give anything just to
            relive those moments.<br />
            ORA ET LABORA.<br />

          <h2>JADAVPUR UNIVERSITY, KOLKATA. <br /></h2>
          <p class="description">
            After i finished my schooling , I moved to kolkata for my higher
            studies. I was fortunate enough to get a seat in one of the top
            institutes in India. Jadavpur University has two campuses, one in
            Jadavpur and the other is in Salt lake. I study in the Salt Lake
            Campus . The environment here is pleasant and relaxing . The campus
            is rather secluded from the extremely busy streets of Kolkata.
            Currently pursuing my BE degree in Information Technology(IT),
            improving my web-dev skills and doing the best I can in academics.
            Its been 3 years since I joined Jadavpur.Away from home ,in this big
            city full of strangers I was perplexed about the idea of being
            alone. Little did I know that I was about to meet the most
            incredibly friendly people on the planet. The friends I met in JU,
            all of them are incredibly smart but if you have the perception that
            all the premier institues comprise mostly of geeks then I'm afraid ,
            I would have to disagree .<br />
          </p>
          <h3>FESTS:</h3>
          <p class="para">
            While there's academic pressure in JU, there's also plenty of room
            for relaxing and having a well balanced college life. The academic
            calendar for the non-freshers starts in the month of July. The
            freshers hit the campus by August and two major fests are organized
            for their welcoming to their new home.(excluding departmental
            freshers ). "U-TURN" is held in the Jadavpur campus and CIIPUS is
            conducted in the salt lake campus, generally in the month of
            September .The month of March marks the commencement of the annual
            techno management fest of Jadavpur University ,"SRIJAN". If you are
            a tech enthusiast then srijan is the way to go for you. A month or
            two before the stressful final semester exams of each year,
            "SANSKRITI" is organized . Sanskriti is a prefect blend of western
            and culutural art forms . Various bands show up with their
            incredible peformances and the entire OAT roars in approval. Its a
            great time to be in JU during the fests. <br />
          </p>
          <h3>MY TIME IN JU:</h3>
          <p class="para">
            I would suggest JU to anyone, It's a once in a lifetime experience.
            I joined in the year 2018. Students come to JU from all over the
            country and its quite a diversity inside the classroom . You
            wouldn't know what its like to study in JU unless you experience it
            for yourself. Campus life is amazing here . The students in the
            hostel have a free internet supply, free electricity and many more,
            basically the government has done its share to help the students out
            financially .
